# 24hr-Story-Feature
This project is a frontend-only clone of the Instagram/WhatsApp "Stories" feature built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to upload short-lived visual content that disappears after 24 hours. All data is stored in the browser using LocalStorage, so no backend is required.

**Features**

📤 Add Story: Upload an image (JPEG/PNG). It’s resized and converted to base64 for storage.

🔄 Auto-expiry: Stories are automatically removed after 24 hours.

⏳ Progress Bar: Displays 3-second viewing per story with auto-play.

👈👉 Swipe & Tap Navigation: Tap or swipe left/right to navigate through stories.

📂 LocalStorage: Stories are saved client-side (in the browser).

🌈 Stylish UI: Mimics Instagram’s visual style with a colorful gradient and frosted story bar.

⚙️ Options Menu: Tap the vertical three-dot icon in the story viewer to:

🗑️ Delete a story
